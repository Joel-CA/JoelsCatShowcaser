    <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: left; font-size: 16px; max-width: 600px;">Unfortunately, in April of 2025
      Milo fell victim to a sudden and unexpected case of anesthesia-induced aspiration pneumonia from what was supposed
      to be a standard procedure at the vet to address a previously suffered nail injury. When he showed symptoms back
      at home, he was taken to an emergency vet. The visit revealed Milo was struggling to breathe and did not have long
      to live. The decision was made to put him to sleep. </p>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px; max-width: 600px;">
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 16px; flex: 1;">Milo provided an unconditional love and friendship that is
        few and far among all the cats or humans I've ever known. Purring was his default state around others. Between
        waking his humans, demanding his food be kept on schedule, and asking for play time (he really loved string),
        having him around was a constant conversation. The silence in the home is painfully loud. Still, even if cut all
        too short, I am thankful to have had Milo in my life at all. I'll carry you in my heart forever my sweet boy.

    <p style="margin-top: 10px; text-align: left; font-size: 16px; max-width: 600px;"> Months later, two gray (formerly)
      stray kitties have found their way into life. Milo would have loved them. Mitchu has sure enoyed the company!</p>
