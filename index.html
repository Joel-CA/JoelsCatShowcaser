  <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Unfortunateley, in April of 2025 Milo fell victim to a sudden and unexpected case of annestecia-induced aspiration pneumonia from what was supposed to be a standard procedure at the vet to address a previously suffered nail injury. When he showed symptoms back at home, he was taken to an emergency vet. The visit revealed Milo was struggling to breathe and did not have long to live. The decision was made to put him to sleep. </p>
    
  <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Milo provided an unconditional love and friendship that is few and far between any cat or humans I've ever known. Purring was his default state around others. Between waking his humans, demanding his food be kept on schedule, and asking for play time (he really loved string), having him around was a constant conversation. The silence in the home is painfully loud. Still, even if cut all too short, I am thankful to have had Milo in my life at all. I'll carry you in my heart forver my sweet boy. </p>
